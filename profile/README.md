# Circlegame

Welcome to Circlegame's open-source repository. Circlegame is a free-to-play 2D aim trainer. Circlegame is both simplistic and unique to all other aim trainers out there. The goal of most gamemodes in the game is to click as many circles as possible. The game has 14 different gamemodes and hopefully many more to come. Anyone is welcome to contribute to the development of Circlegame. If you would like to download the official release of the game, visit our [website](http://circlegame.net/).

## Getting Started

Circlegame is coded entirely using Processing.org's Java library. Processing is a free and open-source visual library for Java, perfect for students who are trying to learn how to program. For more information, click [here](https://processing.org/)

***

### Downloading Processing

In order to contribute to Circlegame, you must [download Processing](https://processing.org/). Processing has its own IDE that you must use to edit and run the code.

***

### Running Circlegame

Once you have downloaded Processing 4, and have cloned our repository to your local machine, in 'circlegame/src/', there will be a file named 'circlegame.pde'. When you open this file, the Processing 4 IDE will open our your device. To run the game, click the play button in the top right corner. Congratulations, you should now be able to make any changes you want and run the code to see the changes you have made!

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute to Circlegame. There are only a few guidelines to be aware of. First, you must fork this respository in order to start making changes. Then, once you are happy with what you have created, create a pull request to this repository. When making pull requests, please make sure they are specific to a function you have added to the game or what type of bug you fixed. This makes it much easier to add your contributions to the original repository. In other words, don't try to make changes to too many places at once. Also, make sure your code is well commented and not disgusting. 

Furthermore, before contributing, there are a few main features of the code that you should be aware of. 

***

### setup()

The setup() function and everything before it is everything that the application does **before** the sketch begins running. This includes variable initialization, loading user data, and initializing the application window. As you are able to see, there are **a lot** of variables that the game uses. These variables are quite the pain to keep track of when you first try to code, but you will get used to this.

***

### draw()

The draw() function is where everything in the program runs. In our draw() function, we call a bunch of fucntions that represents places in the game, such as the menus and different gamemodes. We use boolean values to keep track of what menu/gamemode we are currently in.
